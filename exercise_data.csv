The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season from 2015. Speaking to the Today programme, Claire Enders, media strategy analyst at Enders Analysis, believes that BT Sport is making a big jump to be top of the game. ""BT is making a very decisive move for TV rights that are super premium,"" said Ms Enders. `This deal, to their minds, positions them much more squarely, in a very long term strategy of sports broadcasting. `This move is a strike at Sky's core programming, and it's a sign that BT has an enormous amount of resource.` Richard Brooke, former finance director at BSkyB, feels BT are now `serious about sport`. He explained: `I think what it does, in terms of making the market more competitive... I think the viewer is going to benefit from that. `Sky have really had the field to themselves, and it's ironic that Sky have built up the business by claiming these sports rights from the incumbents, and of course the tables have turned somewhat,` he added. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday 11 November 2013."

Media requires JavaScript to play. Matt Stone and Trey Parker talk about their musical The Book of Mormon South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have taken to the West End stage to introduce their satirical musical The Book of Mormon. Hundreds of fans had queued outside London's Prince of Wales theatre on Monday to see the first UK performance. The Book of Mormon, which lampoons religion and musicals, has already been a huge Broadway hit. To deafening cheers, Parker said: ""It's very cool to be here for the fan performance."" He added: `We heard that a lot of you lined up overnight for tickets... and we want to say from the bottom of our hearts, you're... crazy. We don't know that any show can live up to that.` Continue reading the main story Analysis Will Gompertz Arts editor The Book of Mormon's reputation is built on its biting satire, crude humour and the mocking of Mormonism. There is plenty of all three. But having now seen the show twice, I suspect that at least some of its success is down to its rather conservative nature. Strip away all the vulgarities and what you are left with is a traditionally structured, feel-good musical, which is chock-full of catchy show tunes. Read more from Will The Book of Mormon follows the story of two missionaries who are sent from Salt Lake City to preach in a remote Ugandan village. Written by Stone, Parker and Avenue Q's co-creator Robert Lopez, the show is directed by Parker and Casey Nicholaw. The Broadway show won nine Tony awards last year. It recouped its $11.4m (£7.3m) investment in nine months, making its money back in part by charging up to $477 (£304) for tickets. The West End show is sold out until the end of July, with a small number of daily tickets available via a lottery system. The show's content is not for the faint-hearted, with strong language and jokes about religion, Aids and female circumcision. `We never sit down and say how can we shock,` Parker told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. `It is unconventional material for a musical. That's the sort of stuff that we love.` Stone added: `It's about two white Mormon boys who grew up in Utah and are sent to a place with Old Testament problems - and nothing they've been taught helps them at all with these problems.` Elder Clifford Herbertson, a senior spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the official name of the Mormon Church), said he thought the musical would raise awareness of the church in the UK. `I think the important point is that it's entertainment, it's not education, so it will raise awareness but I don't think it will necessarily help people's understanding or appreciation of the church,` he told the BBC. Scott Brown, New York Magazine's theatre critic, described The Book of Mormon as a `wacky, irreverent tale`. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. `It's one of those revitalising successes,` he told BBC 5 live. `Broadway is like the pharmaceutical business - they crank out all these drugs, but there is just one that carries the rest of the market for a huge amount of time, and this was Broadway's Viagra for a while.` Londoner Christina Tencheva was among those who queued for hours on Monday for a reduced-price ticket to the first performance. `It was outrageous in the best way possible,` she said after the show. `I knew it was going to be rude in places but I came in with an open mind. I think anyone can enjoy it as long as you leave any prejudice at the door.` Anna Koscheck, a regular West End theatre-goer, noted the show's youthful audience. `I pointed out to my friend when we went in that everyone is so young. I don't think I've ever seen that before.` Matt Stone and Trey Parker met at the University of Colorado and as students created the indie film Cannibal! The Musical. Their cartoon series South Park made its TV debut in 1997. The big screen version South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut earned Parker an Oscar nomination for best song in 2000. In 2004, the pair returned to cinemas with Team America: World Police, an adult satire with a cast of marionettes. Stone and Parker then spent seven years working on The Book of Mormon, which opened on Broadway in March 2011."

By Tom de Castella and Brian Wheeler BBC News Magazine Continue reading the main story In today's Magazine How safe do women feel on a night out? Growing up as a Benedict Is romantic love a bad thing? How the 1960s changed the Pope The horsemeat scandal has already been blamed on organised crime. But how common is food fraud and do long, complicated supply chains allow it to happen? The mystery of how horsemeat got into Findus beef lasagne has led to an international hunt already taking in four countries. The meat appears to have arrived in the UK via a factory in Luxembourg belonging to French food supplier Comigel. It reached there from Spanghero, a food plant in France, which in turn received horsemeat from Romania. Comigel's president claims the company was unaware that Spanghero's meat was coming from abroad. Many, including Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, suspect criminal gangs are to blame. ""What a mess the processed meat trade seems to have got into,"" says Tim Lang, professor of food policy at London's City University. `The much-vaunted control of big companies over their supply chains is looking tattered.` There has always been food fraud. Once upon a time it might have been watered down beer or bread adulterated with sawdust. Today, rising food prices, long supply chains and high mark ups on some foods have made fraud easier and more profitable. Continue reading the main story Foods prone to fraud Olive oil, milk, honey, saffron (pictured), coffee and apple and orange juices most commonly reported to have been fraudulently adulterated* May be diluted with cheaper or potentially harmful substitute Or cheap alternative deliberately mislabelled as luxury ingredient (*study didn't examine processed foods such as breakfast cereals and ready meals) Source: Global study in Journal of Food Science What to do if you suspect food fraud (FSA) Hundreds of tonnes of fraudulent food were seized in raids across Europe in December 2011. Food fraud had become very attractive to criminal gangs, says Europol project manager Chris Vansteenkiste. `There is a much bigger market. Not everyone wants to take drugs, but everyone has to eat and drink.` The current scandal is over processed beef but fraud happens in all manner of foodstuffs. Operation Opson in 2011 targeted ports, airports and retail outlets in 10 European countries, including the UK. Among the products seized were 13,000 bottles of substandard olive oil, 30 tonnes of fake tomato sauce, about 77,000 kg of counterfeit cheese, 12,000 bottles of substandard wine, five tonnes of substandard fish and seafood; and nearly 30,000 counterfeit confectionery bars. But it seems to be meat fraud that consumers find most unpalatable. It's a global phenomenon. A meat packing factory in China was recently found to be selling cheap duck meat as mutton and beef. The Findus horsemeat episode has shown up how vulnerable meat in Europe is. In another recent case, Flexi Foods Ltd in Hull has been named in a statement by Irish firm McAdam Foods as the supplier of Polish meat found to contain horse DNA. The supply chain for meat can be complex but varies widely. The animal may go straight from farm to abattoir or be traded at a livestock market. Once at the abattoir it may go on somewhere or be sent to a cutting plant beside the abattoir. It might then go on to a food manufacturer that turns it into lasagne. Supermarkets such as Morrisons and Waitrose publicise their short supply chains If the meat is imported it might have been slaughtered in one European country, sent to another plant, and then processed at a third plant before arriving at a manufacturing plant in the UK. Supermarkets have different approaches to supply chains. Waitrose sources all its beef from one supplier, Dovecote Park in Yorkshire, which supplies only to Waitrose. All the beef used in the supermarket's ready meals is British. Continue reading the main story Chef's view Rowley Leigh, head chef at Le Cafe Anglais, has little faith in labelling for free range and organic produce. As a restaurateur he is able to source his food raw and direct from the producer. `I buy it myself. I don't know how good a life the chicken has had. But I can tell if it's been properly reared and husbanded.` A badly reared chicken is henpecked and lacks muscle and fat, he says. When it comes to vegetables the key is to buy local, seasonal produce such as the `huge amounts` of purple sprouting broccoli currently on sale. `We know absolutely where it's coming from,` a spokesman says. Most of the ready meals are own brand. The ones that aren't are small UK producers, he says. It is a far shorter supply chain than one reaching Romania. Rival British chain Morrisons is currently running an advertising campaign, fronted by television presenters Ant and Dec, that emphasises the provenance of their meat. Dalton Philips, chief executive of Morrisons, has argued that the supply chain has become `far too complex`. He said there need only be four parts - farmer, abattoir, meat manufacturing plant and retailer. Supermarket group Aldi, one of those supplying the contaminated Findus products, refused to comment when asked for details on the supply chain for its own-brand meat. `The more complexity in the supply chain, the more likely the products involved are likely to have issues of authenticity,` says Chris Elliott, chairman of food safety and microbiology at Queen's University Belfast. Some processed food products have ingredients sourced from 20 different countries. Each ingredient may have been through multiple countries. It may come as a surprise to some people that European produce arriving at UK ports is not checked. Random checks are carried out on all foodstuffs further down the line by trading standards and environmental health officers, a spokeswoman for the Food Standards Agency says. The agency insists food fraud is not a major problem in the UK but some believe the scale has been underestimated. It's difficult to predict what effect the horsemeat scandal will have on consumers in the UK and elsewhere. Some, disgusted by the adulteration, will no doubt be put off cheap ready meals full of processed meat. Continue reading the main story China's 2008 melamine scandal Milk powder contaminated with melamine, a chemical used for plastics Secretly added to make milk appear higher in protein Six babies die, 300,000 infants made ill, causing national outcry Milk producers, traders and executives convicted Two people executed But much of the food fraud in Europe has revolved around the more expensive end of the market, says Vansteenkiste. The rise in fraud makes high value products like organic and free range particularly vulnerable. About half of the goods seized in Operation Opson were counterfeit brands and the other half `sub-standard` products, such as `wild salmon` which was in fact farmed, `organic` soup cubes, fake coffee and caviar. In one case an Italian gang were jailed for selling organic soya beans which were found to have been treated with pesticides. `As a police officer or customs officer, if some ingredients are imported in bulk you cannot check them for authenticity,` Vansteenkiste notes. Stuart Shotton, of Food Chain Europe, which advises food manufacturers on compliance with safety laws, says: `It is one of those areas where if you do look too deep you might find something that you don't want to find out about. Continue reading the main story Previously in the Magazine Swedish prosecutors claim to have cracked one of Europe's more seemingly strange, if lucrative, smuggling rings. Two British men are believed to have made millions of euros smuggling Chinese garlic from Norway into Sweden, thus avoiding the EU's 9.6% duty on imported foreign garlic. Fraud and irregularities with Chinese fresh garlic have occurred since the 1990s, says Pavel Borkovec of the European Anti-Fraud Office. `One container of fresh garlic represents a potential risk of about 30,000 euros (£24,700) in terms of customs duties.` Why do criminals smuggle garlic? `As long as there are premium prices to pay for certain products, there will always be people out there looking to make a fast buck.` Ed Bedington, editor of Meat Trades Journal, says the Findus horse meat case has brought into question the security of supply chains. `Retailers make great play about the audits they do and the robustness of the supply chain. But as a long-term observer of the sector, it calls all that into question.` Proper audits should pick up on these things. But minced horse and minced beef look very similar, says Bedington. `Unless you're testing it for DNA, infra red then you don't know.` Consumer confidence is at stake, says Stephen Rossides, director of the British Meat Processors Association. The food industry will need to increase the amount of testing it does on products. Up to now DNA testing has not been `terribly widespread`, says Rossides. It is expensive and involves looking for specific things. One example of DNA testing is checking that a burger comes from Aberdeen Angus beef. It's very hard to prove that organic or free range really is what it claims to be. There is a large element of trust in the process. Even with simple, seemingly trustworthy supply chains, there can still be problems. In Northern Ireland there is a system that allows you to trace back to the farm and even when the produce was harvested, Elliott says. Even there it was recently found that a firm was producing halal meat that contained pork. No system is infallible, but customers may veer towards products with simpler supply chains in the immediate future. You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

One version will feature 12 gigabytes of flash memory, allowing it to become the cheapest PS3 to date. The other has a 500GB hard disk and will be sold for roughly the price of the previous 320GB model. The PS3 has been outsold by Microsoft's Xbox 360 for 20 months running in the US - the world's biggest games market, according to data from NPD. Demand for the portable games console - the PlayStation Vita - has also been weaker than expected, forcing Sony to cut sales forecasts. The firm reported a 24.6bn yen ($314m; £202m) net loss for the April-June period, adding to a 456.7bn yen ($5.7bn; £3.5bn) deficit for the previous financial year. It also faces the imminent launch of Nintendo's next-generation console. The Wii U goes on sale in the US on 18 November and in Europe 12 days later, giving its maker an advantage in the busy Christmas shopping period. Cutting costs Sony says the revised models are less than half the size and weight of the original PS3 launched in 2006, and a 20-25% reduction on the previous models. The 500GB version will go on sale on 28 September in the UK and the 12GB device on 12 October. One industry watcher said the move would help Sony in the run-up to Christmas. ""A smaller form factor is not only more attractive to many consumers, it will cost less to manufacture, ship and stock,"" Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Screen Digest, told the BBC. `That is likely to open the door to better margins and will allow Sony a chance to be more aggressive on pricing running into 2013.` Mr Harding-Rolls added that while Microsoft had outperformed Sony in the US, the picture was different elsewhere. According to data from IHS, Sony sold four million PS3s in the first half of 2012 across Europe, the US, Australia and Japan, while Microsoft sold three million Xbox 360s. Family friendly? HMV is offering the 12GB device for £185 - it charged £200 for the 160GB PlayStation Slim. Sony indicated that the lower price might help the device appeal to families - the same `casual gamer` audience typically targeted by Nintendo. The Diggs Nightcrawler Wonderbook allows users to investigate Humpty Dumpty's `downfall` Sony underlined its intention to broaden its appeal to a younger audience with an earlier announcement about its forthcoming Wonderbooks - augmented reality titles that will display interactive content on a screen when the user places a compatible book in front of an attached camera. The software includes a new Harry Potter title and a Walking With Dinosaurs release based on the BBC documentary series. `The Nintendo brand is very strong with the family audience but Sony is throwing its weight behind marketing Wonderbooks this Christmas,` said Christopher Dring, associate editor of the MCV video games trade news magazine. `Bearing in mind Sony's hardware will also likely be cheaper and it also has other family stuff like Singstar - a karaoke game that appeals to a young audience - there could be a big fight over the next few months.`"

Continue reading the main story Related Stories Japan runs record trade deficit Japan gets $116bn stimulus boost Shinzo Abe's economic challenge Japan's economy contracted for the third straight quarter in the three months to end of December, underlining the challenges the new government faces in reviving growth. The economy shrank 0.1% compared with the previous three months. Most analysts had forecast growth of 0.1%. That is equivalent to an annualised dip of 0.4% in gross domestic product. Japan's growth has been hurt by a drop in exports to key markets as well as subdued domestic consumption. `The biggest reason for the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) is external demand was weak and domestic demand did not recover as quickly as we thought,` said Shuji Tonouchi of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) left its interest rates unchanged at between zero to 0.1%. However, it rejected a proposal to keep the rates at that level until its target of achieving a 2% rate of inflation is met. The central bank had set that target last month, in an attempt to spur domestic demand. Japan has been fighting deflation, or falling prices, for best part of the past decade. That has hurt domestic demand as consumers tend to put off purchases in the hope of getting a cheaper and better deal later on. Many analysts have said that stoking inflation is key to spurring Japan's domestic consumption. Bottoming out? Continue reading the main story “Start Quote The economy has contracted for three straight quarters, but the third quarter was the worst and fourth quarter data show the pace of decline is slowing” End Quote Shuji Tonouchi Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Japan's new government led by Shinzo Abe has said that reviving the country's economy is its top priority. Last month, it approved a fresh 10.3 trillion yen ($116bn; £72bn) stimulus package in an attempt to spur a revival in the economy. The package, which includes infrastructure spending, as well as incentives for businesses to boost investment, is estimated to boost Japan's economy by 2% and create 600,000 jobs. Japan's central bank also expanded its asset purchase programme in January, which is to expected to pump billions of yen into the economy. Analysts said these moves were likely to help spur growth in the Japanese economy in the current quarter. `The economy has contracted for three straight quarters, but the third quarter was the worst and fourth quarter data show the pace of decline is slowing,` said Mr Tonouchi of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities `Data show that overseas economies are recovering, so we expect Japan to return to growth in the first quarter. `The economy is still on the recovery track,` he added. Yen effect The measures by the central bank, coupled with the hopes that it may ease its policies further in the coming months, has had a big impact on the yen. The Japanese currency has dipped more than 15% against the US dollar since November last year. Continue reading the main story US Dollar v Japanese Yen Last Updated at 20 Feb 2013, 09:00 $1 buys change % 93.3635 - -0.21 - -0.22 A weak currency bodes well for Japanese exporters as it makes their goods more affordable to foreign buyers, but also helps boost their profits when they repatriate their foreign earnings back home. Analysts said the timing of the drop in yen's value has been great for the exporters. `We are nearing the end of the financial year, a time when leading exporters will be looking at closing their books and transferring their overseas earnings back to Japan,` Martin Schulz of Fujitsu Research Institute told the BBC. Mr Schulz said that given the sharp drop in yen's value, leading exporters were likely to see profits exceed their previous forecasts. He explained that a profit boost would mean that firms were likely to have much more cash available for investment. `As global demand begins to rise and Japan's goods become more affordable, companies are likely to use that cash pile to expand their facilities. `That will help boost Japan's economy further in the coming months.` Mr Schulz added."

Cheery carmakers flock to Detroit Car firms axe jobs as demand slumps French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen has reported a net loss of 5bn euros ($6.7bn; £4.3bn) for 2012, compared with a 588m euro profit a year earlier. The loss was mainly due to asset write-downs which Peugeot took to reflect the worsening state of Europe's car market. The carmaker said the write-down on assets totalled 4.7bn euros. Last year, Peugeot announced a programme to cut its costs by 1bn euros in response to falling sales, including the closure of one factory. French unions have succeeded in stalling the closure plans in the French courts, but Peugeot said it had succeeded in cutting 1.2bn euros over the past 12 months despite that. ""The results of the cost reduction and asset disposal plans have exceeded our targets,"" said chief executive Philippe Varin, claiming that, `the foundations for our rebound have been laid`. Group revenues were down 5.2% on 2011, at 58.4bn euros, and income from new car sales fell 12.4% to 27.8bn euros. The company blamed `the deteriorated environment in the automotive sector in Europe` for the poor results.

Eco car Fisker's unique hybrid tech Watch Toyota previews self-driving car Watch Click's report into the future of the car industry Five years ago mobile phones were at the forefront of technology, by 2010 the focus was on tablet computers and now billions of yen, dollars and pounds are being invested in what is seen as the next digital playground - the car. Using a hand-held mobile phone while driving a car has been illegal in the UK since 2003. But 10 years later, car manufacturers are hoping that the technology regularly found on smartphones could change the way we use our cars. Technology is helping motorists drive safely by sensing nearby vehicles What this means is app-culture infiltrating the dashboard - from a parking space finder to a way to get coupons for local restaurants, or directions that can pop up on the windscreen. It all relies on the car being connected to the internet, allowing all this information to arrive without too much searching or button pushing and a lot more focus on voice commands. The connected car is already the third fastest growing technological device after phones and tablets, Intel believes. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote By the end of 2014, every vehicle [big brands] sell will offer some sort of connectivity” End Quote Jack Bergquist IHS information ""Ford has categorically stated that this is selling more cars for them,"" says Jack Bergquist of information company IHS. `Over 50% of consumers would be swayed by the presence of an internet-capable device.` The phrase currently being used to describe all this connected material is `infotainment`. Free parking At present, headlines often focus on the use of social media, integrated internet radio or clever ways to use voice commands. But the internet could be used for much more simple - and practical - things. Science fiction has regularly shown examples of what a more intelligent car could accomplish There are already apps that can show local petrol stations and their prices, allowing drivers to keep going for a few more miles to save a few pence a litre when filling up a car. There is also an app to find a car parking space in some major cities, using electronic sensors, or analysing an aerial view of local street spaces. Perhaps more interesting are the things you never knew you could find out. When stopped at a traffic light, trials have shown a system where a time can pop up on the dashboard letting drivers know how long until it changes. This is not a cheap business. It is thought billions of pounds have been spent so far on the development of these services. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote It will not be car companies but actually someone like Apple or Facebook who will successfully challenge the car manufacturers” End Quote John Leech KPMG By 2020, $600 billion (£380bn) - or 20% of the value of new connected vehicles - will be able to be attributed to `connected life`, according to Machina Research. Intel alone is investing $100 million (£64m) in the next five years in companies that can quicken the adoption of connected cars. `By the end of 2014, for some of the bigger brands, every vehicle they sell will offer some sort of connectivity,` says Bergquist. `If you look at a cost to design a completely new car model, some companies are spending around a third of the budget just on the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and the in-car technology around the system.` More crashes? With driving currently taking every bit of the driver's attention - until at least more progress is made on self-driving cars - critics have warned of safety concerns. Around a quarter of all traffic crashes in the US are caused by mobile phone use in some way, the National Safety Council says. If all this information becomes even easier to access, is there an even greater risk of distraction? Google has already made headway in driving hardware as well as software `The danger is safety,` John Ellis, global technologist for connected services and solutions at Ford, said at a CES 2013 discussion. `You could get caught up in your experience and forget that you're driving. Better, faster cheaper is what consumers want - but with safety.` Safety concerns are being addressed with a mandatory sensor which calls emergency services in the event of an accident. Titled eCall, under EU plans all new cars will be fitted with it by 2015. But it is not just on-road safety that is causing developers headaches. `People being able to hack into the car is a big issue,` says Bergquist. `If there's a data system in a car, technically someone could hack into it.` This hacking has been demonstrated by security consultants who unlocked the doors of a car and started the engine without a key or touching the vehicle itself. It is done by intercepting wireless messages between the car and the network. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote Sometimes, removing tech reveals a whole new opportunity. CD players are slowly disappearing from the dash” End Quote Ian Hardy BBC Click Find out more on BBC Click But the risk, analysts believe, is small because of time spent on security by the companies involved and the risks of failure. `Theoretically, hacking is possible, but car companies are very aware of that risk and busily preparing themselves,` says John Leech, of KPMG. `Connected cars will have to be released with appropriately designed security to prevent that hacking.` In Ford's new systems, for example, apps are physically separated from vehicle critical devices - making it, it says, impossible to hack between the two. 'Apple or Facebook' At the moment, a system removed from major mobile operating systems like Android or iOS still exists. Android-based systems have already been demonstrated by a company working in partnership with BMW and most systems in cars can communicate with these devices. But there are predictions that one or two developers are researching ways to turn car technology on its head. `I suspect it will not be car companies but actually someone like Apple or Facebook who will successfully challenge the car manufacturers,` says Leech. `It's going to have to be integrated with mobile platforms. `Apple already has a very significant automotive team looking at how best Apple products can be used in-car. If I was betting, that's where I'd put my money.` A lot of companies are betting a lot of money on this industry continuing to grow rapidly. If these companies are right, it is only a matter of time before the car could directly compete with the phone and the tablet to be the biggest smart industry. You can safely expect more puns around digital highways, driving data and speeding up innovation to be not too far away."

The UK's Carbon Trust, which developed the scheme, said many business leaders did not see the issue as a priority. The Water Standard will require firms to measure water use and demonstrate efforts taken to reduce consumption. It is estimated that more than 60% of Europe's largest cities consume water faster than it can be replenished. UN data shows that 70% of global freshwater use is for irrigation, 22% is used by industry and 8% is used in homes.

""We know that most businesses that are very big users of water don't really have a handle on [water stewardship],"" explained Carbon Trust chief executive Tom Delay. `Very few measure it, even fewer have targets to reduce consumption. So even if there is not a significant cost penalty for water use, there is a very significant business risk.` In order to be awarded the Carbon Trust Water standard, Mr Delay said the process was `relatively straightforward`. The Carbon Trust said that there was no global standard for business water reduction `They need to be able to show us that on a year-on-year basis they are reducing their water use,` he told BBC News. `We look at the various water supply methods: mains, surface water abstraction, groundwater and rainwater collection. `All of the water than comes into the company we will count as an input. We will also look at trade effluent because it is the dirty water and normally needs to be licensed and manage very carefully. `We are looking for companies that are awarded the Standard to show a year-on-year reduction on both water input and effluent.` The Trust decided to branch out from its usual territory of measuring energy use and carbon footprints because there was not a global standard on water reduction, he added. `We firmly believe that if you measure something and if you manage it, then you will reduce it and improve its performance. But, he said: `We are not covering every single angle of water stewardship in this standard [but] we are saying that if you can reduce that then that is moving in the right direction.` Mr Delay explained that the issue of water scarcity was closely linked to climate change because `one of the big impacts will be the threat to freshwater supplies`. 'Early adopters' Among the four `early adopters` of the standard was Coca-Cola, whose operations in India had been criticised by campaigners who said the firm was abstracting too much water, which was having a detrimental impact on surrounding farmland. Mr Delay said that the Trust's standard had been awarded to Coca-Cola Enterprises, which was responsible for the northern European operations of the global brand. But he added: `The more people get into managing their water use, the more they will be exposed these sorts of questions and, hopefully, come up with some solutions.` On the website for the Coca-Cola Great Britain, which is a separate company to the Enterprises operation, it said: `We believe we can be part of the solution to India's water issues and we've made water stewardship the primary focus of our sustainability efforts throughout the country. `We've improved our water use efficiency by 14% since 2004 and we're continuing to invest in new innovations and plant processes to help us make even more improvements moving forward.` Commenting on the launch of the Water Standard, Coca-Cola Enterprises chairman and chief executive John Brock described water as `fundamental to our business and our communities`. `By measuring and managing our water impact... we can address longer-term water scarcity issues,` he said. `This certification recognises the progress we have made towards becoming a water-sustainable operation.`"

The box office success in China of low-budget hit Lost in Thailand has revived hopes for the country's film industry. Late one evening in December, a crowd gathered in the foyer of a Beijing cinema after failing to secure a ticket for the day's final show. ""Even the front row seats are all sold out,"" the teller patiently told the crowd. As it became clear people were in no mood to go home, staff agreed to an additional showing. It's a scene that played out in cinemas across the country. The movie in question was not a Hollywood blockbuster or even a state-backed propaganda extravaganza. It was a low budget, slapstick comedy that has unexpectedly become China's highest-grossing homegrown film. Lost in Thailand has taken $200m (£130m) since its release on 12 December, according to entertainment consultancy Entgroup. It has taken more at the Chinese box office than Titanic and comes close to Avatar, which raked in $220m (£142m).

Its success has revived hopes for China's movie industry, which has struggled to compete against Hollywood's big budget, special-effect laden productions. The film tells the tale of a businessman who travels to Thailand to find his boss and then finds himself embroiled in a series of bizarre capers involving kickboxing, snakes, gangsters and a pancake-maker he meets on a plane. `It's a very funny, very well made, mass-market comedy, which is well scripted and has an exotic location,` said Patrick Frater, chief executive of Film Business Asia. `It is not a masterpiece but it's on the money in making a reasonably-intelligent commercial film, which clearly people have responded to.` It's also a sequel to 2010's Lost on Journey which means it has a `built-in audience`, Mr Frater adds. 'Bigger meaning' As a light-hearted comedy, it contrasts with the historical epics and action flicks that make up most of China's domestic film releases, says Liv Yi, an analyst at Beijing-based entertainment industry consultancy Entgroup. Its depiction of a status-conscious businessman who falls for the simple life also struck a chord with audiences who are beginning to question China's materialistic society. `It's a small story but it has a bigger meaning. In China today, too many people worship money,` Christy Bai, a teacher from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen told BBC News. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Lost in Thailand will show in cinemas in Thailand and Malaysia But the success of the movie has not been universally welcomed. University professor Xiao Su told the Changjiang Daily the movie was `vulgar`, adding that movies should seek to improve ordinary people's cultural quality and taste rather than focus on box office takings. Lost in Thailand's success comes at a time when Chinese movies appear to be losing ground to their Hollywood counterparts. In 2012, imported foreign films captured a larger share of box office receipts than domestic movies for the first time in six years. This was partly because last year, after years of Hollywood lobbying, China enlarged its quota on imported films from 20 to 34. Lost in Thailand was released in the US last weekend Censorship is one factor holding the industry back - films dealing with religion, politics and sex are unlikely to pass muster. `There is no PG or 18 category so films have to be approved for a wide audience and nobody is ever quite sure what will make it through,` says Film Business Asia's Mr Frater. Film production companies rarely know with certainty when their film will be released or which scenes will make the final cut, making it harder to promote their production at home and overseas. Lost in Thailand was released in Hong Kong at the end of January and was given a limited release in the US last weekend. With some high-profile exceptions, Chinese-language films have been a hard sell to English speaking audiences. Entgroup's Ms Yi says it's unlikely to become another Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the 2000 martial arts movie that is still China's biggest movie export to date. `I think it's a very Chinese type of humour - I'm not sure whether foreigners like you will like it,` she tells me."

Robotic arm controlled by thought Bionics: The next generation Unrivalled control of a robotic arm has been achieved using a paralysed woman's thoughts, a US study says. Jan Scheuermann, who is 53 and paralysed from the neck down, was able to deftly grasp and move a variety of objects just like a normal arm. Brain implants were used to control the robotic arm, in the study reported in the Lancet medical journal. Experts in the field said it was an ""unprecedented performance"" and a `remarkable achievement`. Jan was diagnosed with spinocerebellar degeneration 13 years ago and progressively lost control of her body. She is now unable to move her arms or legs. Robo-arm She was implanted with two sensors - each four millimetres by four millimetres - in the motor cortex of her brain. Continue reading the main story “Start Quote I don't know how to say it any other way, [the movement is] way better than anything that's been demonstrated before” End Quote Prof Andrew Schwartz University of Pittsburgh A hundred tiny needles on each sensor pick up the electrical activity from about 200 individual brain cells. `The way that neurons communicate with each other is by how fast they fire pulses, it's a little bit akin to listening to a Geiger counter click, and it's that property that we lock onto,` said Professor Andrew Schwartz from the University of Pittsburgh. The pulses of electricity in the brain are then translated into commands to move the arm, which bends at the elbow, wrist and could grab an object. Jan was able to control the arm after the second day of training and over a period of 14 weeks became increasing skilful. The report said she gained `co-ordination, skill and speed almost similar to that of an able-bodied person` by the end of the study. Prof Schwartz told the BBC that movements this good had not been achieved before. `They're fluid and they're way better, I don't know how to say it any other way, they're way better than anything that's been demonstrated before. `I think it really is convincing evidence that this technology is going to be therapeutic for spinal cord injured people. `They are doing tasks already that would be beneficial in their daily lives and I think that's fairly conclusive at this point.` The arm was controlled by thought Sense of touch The field of harnessing a healthy brain to overcome a damaged body is advancing rapidly. Earlier this year, Cathy Hutchinson used a robotic arm to serve herself a drink for the first time since her stroke 15 years before. In both studies the results were achieved inside a laboratory so are of little help in the home. Researchers are now trying to mount the arm on Jan's wheelchair so she will be able to use it in her everyday life. There are also attempts to give sensation to the prosthetic arms to restore a sense of touch. In a review researchers Gregoire Courtine, Silvesto Micera, Jack DiGiovanna and Jose del Millan described the control of the arm as `highly intuitive and probably responsible for the unprecedented performance of the brain-machine interface`. They added that the system was a `remarkable technological and biomedical achievement` and that such designs were getting closer to a point which `might soon become revolutionary treatment models` for paralysed patients."

Workers in the UK are earning no more than they were 10 years ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). After adjusting for inflation, it said pay levels peaked in 2009. Between then and 2012 the ONS said pay had fallen by 3% in real terms. On average, it said workers were therefore earning roughly the same last year as they were ten years ago, in 2003. The TUC said the figures came as no surprise. ""Official figures now confirm what everyone knows. Living standards have been falling for the vast majority, and there is no sign of change,"" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary. According to the ONS, average pay in 2009 was £12.25 an hour. After adjusting for inflation, that fell to £11.92 in 2010 and £11.41 in 2011.

Public sector workers saw more of an increase in their earnings during the boom years up to 2009, and the subsequent decline in earnings was not as steep. Living standards The outlook for those whose incomes have been squeezed may not be much better. It could be another 10 years before living standards return to the levels they were at before the recession, according to a report from the Resolution Foundation, a think tank dedicated to improving the lives of those on middle and low incomes. Many workers are now earning the same as they were in the early 2000's It says many people in this section of society could face a permanent hit to their expected levels of prosperity. `Without steady growth in earnings, living standards will continue to stagnate,` said Gavin Kelly, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. `We can't just return to the skewed growth of the past, when too many on low and middle incomes failed to keep up with overall rises in prosperity,` he said. The report suggests that if incomes now rise by just over 1% above inflation, it will take until 2023 for people to regain the living standards they had in 2008, when the recession began. By that time their earnings might recover to £22,000 a year."

They are known to exist at the centres of most galaxies, but a puzzle remains as to how they affect galaxy evolution. The approach, published in Nature, infers a black hole's mass from the speed of molecules swirling around it. It could help weigh hundreds of nearby black holes. Its first use suggests a black hole in the NGC4526 galaxy has a mass 450 million times that of our Sun. Only in a few dozen cases have the masses of supermassive black holes been estimated. Because they cannot be seen directly, astronomers have relied on guessing how large they are based on the motion of objects circling them. Most estimates have come from gathering up starlight. This can be done by calculating how much faster the stars nearer the black hole are moving relative to those farther away. However, that is an average measure, and the ""random motions"" of stars - not necessarily in the same direction as the swirling mass - blurs the measurement. The movement of electrically charged gas can be tracked in the same way, with slightly less blurring due to random motion. But these approaches remain painstaking and limited to only the nearest galaxies' black holes. Continue reading the main story Black holes These are regions of space where gravity is so powerful that not even light can escape One way they can form is when huge stars collapse in on themselves So-called supermassive black holes sit at the centres of galaxies, including the Milky Way Brian Cox on what happens near black holes The new work focuses instead on cold, dense masses of gas that have markedly less random motion, and which emit their radiation in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. That allows the use of telescopes and arrays with far better resolution. Timothy Davis of the European Southern Observatory and colleagues made use of the Carma array of telescopes in California, US, looking specifically for the radiation coming from molecules of carbon monoxide. They focused their efforts on NGC4526, mapping out the movements of the molecules at various distances from the galaxy's central black hole. Using their new technique, they estimated the black hole has a mass of some 900 billion trillion trillion tonnes - on the heavy side even in the supermassive stakes. Estimates such as this may help finally unravel the interplay between black holes and the galaxies that host them. `Galaxies and black holes seem to be related to each other; there's this relation between the mass of the black hole and properties of the galaxy,` explained Dr Davis. `That's rather weird, because these black holes are tiny compared to galaxies; they don't weigh that much, and they're physically small - less than the size of our Solar System in a galaxy that's billions of times bigger,` he told BBC News. `What we'd really like to understand is how these two components interact; why they care about each other at all. To do that, we need to be able to measure their masses, and compare them in all sorts of different galaxies. That will allow us to start answering these questions.` With the new method in hand, Dr Davis said that next-generation telescopes tuned to these microwave frequencies - such as the Alma telescope in Chile - would be able to easily acquire the masses of hundreds of black holes. `The observations we present in the paper took over 100 hours on the Carma telescope,` he said. `We estimate that with Alma you'll be able to reproduce those observation in 10 minutes. It's a real game-changer.` The estimate was based on data gathered at the 23-telescope Carma array in California"

The iPhone-maker said a small number of its machines were affected, but added there was ""no evidence"" of data theft. Last week Facebook said it had traced a cyber attack back to China which had infiltrated employees' laptops. Apple said it would release a software update to protect customers against the malicious software used in the attack. In a statement, the Cupertino, California-based firm said: `Apple has identified malware which infected a limited number of Mac systems through a vulnerability in the Java plug-in for browsers. `The malware was employed in an attack against Apple and other companies, and was spread through a website for software developers. `We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them from our network. There is no evidence that any data left Apple. `We are working closely with law enforcement to find the source of the malware.` Java vulnerabilities News of the hack comes as a US-based cyber security firm claimed to have pinpointed a specific building in Shanghai that was being used to house one of the world's `most prolific cyber espionage groups`.

The South Korean firm had sought an injunction in a German court arguing Apple's VoiceOver screen-access facility infringed one of its patents. However, the judge has ordered the case to be suspended pending another ruling that could invalidate Samsung's claim. Disability campaigners had expressed concern about the case. Apple's VoiceOver function is used by blind and partially-sighted people to hear a description of what the iPhone is showing by touching its screen. The software covers text and icons including audio descriptions of the battery level and network signal. It also allows the phones to be operated via Braille-based add-ons. Samsung had argued that Apple had failed to licence a patent it owned which describes pressing a button to make a handset describe its display. The basis for this was that VoiceOver could be switched on by triple-clicking the iPhone's home button. Apple declined to comment. A statement from Samsung said: ""For decades, we have heavily invested in pioneering the development of technological innovations in the mobile industry, which have been constantly reflected in our products. ""We continue to believe that Apple has infringed our patented mobile technologies, and we will continue to take the measures necessary to protect our intellectual property rights.` 'Regrettable in the extreme' Patent consultant Florian Muller, who was first to report the Mannheim Court's decision, questioned Samsung's tactics. `If Samsung had only requested monetary compensation in this action, it would have made a much better choice than by trying to achieve, through the pursuit of an injunction, the deactivation or (more realistically) degradation of the voiceover functionality Apple provides to its German customers,` he wrote on his blog. The British Computer Association of the Blind said it was worried such an important feature might be threatened. `A lack of access to information is arguably the biggest potential barrier to inclusion in society for blind and partially-sighted people,` a spokesman told the BBC. `If something as important as access to telephone technology had been blocked by the actions of one company over another the consequences for blind people everywhere would be regrettable in the extreme.` The Wall Street Journal's AllThingsD tech site was more damning. `Leaving aside the ethics of asserting a patent against a feature designed to help the blind, this is unwise,` wrote John Paczkowski. `It's the PR equivalent of punching yourself in the face. Samsung has now identified itself as a company willing to accept the loss of accessibility for the vision-impaired as collateral damage in its battle with Apple.` Apple and Samsung have fought a number of patent cases against each other in courts across the world. The biggest award involved a US jury ordering Samsung to pay Apple $1.05bn (£688m) in damages. The judge in the case later rejected Apple's call for the sum to be increased and a sales ban on some Samsung handsets."

Qing Wang is accused of sending carved rhino cups to Mr Li in Hong Kong. US federal law bars trafficking in endangered species. Mr Li and Mr Wei are Chinese nationals. The investigation was carried out by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. According to prosecutors, Mr Li sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to a co-conspirator in the US to buy rhino horns, which were sent in porcelain vases to another person in Hong Kong, in an effort to evade US authorities. 'Good health' Mr Li is also accused of trying to buy two rhino horns for $59,000 (£38,000) in a hotel room in Miami in January from an undercover fish and wildlife officer. He also asked the undercover officer to procure more horns and send them to Hong Kong. Mr Wei, who was sharing a hotel room with Mr Li, later asked an undercover informant to take a fish and wildlife officer out for dinner and offer her money to help Mr Li, prosecutors said. Meanwhile, prosecutors say Mr Wang bought libation cups carved from rhino horn in the US and sent them to Mr Li in Hong Kong. Some believe drinking from intricately carved rhino horn cups brings good health, and the cups are highly prized by collectors, US authorities said. Native to Africa, the black rhinoceros is classified as a critically endangered species, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. But demand for rhino horns and the prices paid for them on the black market have soared in recent years, US prosecutors said."

Local communities supported the bid, with residents in Talybont-on-Usk holding their own Star Party and organising a community light switch off. Martin Morgan-Taylor, board member of the International Dark-Sky Association, the US based organisation which awards the status, said the gradual loss of the view of the night sky was a loss of part of culture. `Whilst no-one wants all the lights to be switched off, we can improve the lighting we use in towns and cities. `However, the best views of the night sky come from places such as the Brecon Beacons, who have dedicated themselves to protecting and restoring the night sky for all to enjoy.` Jim Wilson, chairman of Brecon Beacons Park Society, thanked all those who had taken part in the project, saying it recognised the park as one of the best places in Europe to see truly dark skies.

Imports of gold jewellery rose after the government increased duties on import of raw gold, including bars and coins, three times this year. Demand for gold in India has risen after the recent drop in prices. However, gold imports are also one of the biggest contributors to India's widening current account deficit. A current account deficit is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign currency and it occurs when a country's total imports are greater than its exports. A widening deficit strains the country's foreign exchange reserves, as well as the value of its currency.
